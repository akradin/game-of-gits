House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned lived and led a prosperous life until he went to a coding school and lost
his mind. He never fully recovered and was thus removed from House Stark.
He began his own House called WDI.
